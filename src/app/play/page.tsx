        <p>
          Start by making sure you have created an account and are logged in.
          You must be logged in to add decks and spectate or play games. Jigoku
          Online has a functional <a href="/decks">Deckbuilder</a>, although
          most people use the more fully featured{" "}

          deckbuilder to build their decks. After building your deck on
          FiveRingsDB, copy the Permalink URL, paste it into popup window in the
          deckbuilder that is brought up when you click 'Import Deck'. You are
          now ready to start playing. Head over to the <a href="/play">Play</a>{" "}
          section to create, join or watch games.
        </p>
        <h3 id="profile">Profile Options</h3>
        <p>
          Clicking your <a href="/profile">Profile</a> at the top right of the
          page allows you to tailor certain aspects of gameplay to your wishes.
        </p>
        <h4 id="action">Action Windows</h4>
        <p>
          Legend of the Five Rings has quite a large number of phases and their
          associated action windows, a number of which are not used regularly by
          all decks. Always prompting these action windows leads to a lot of
          tediously clicking ‘Pass’, while never prompting these action windows
          leads to certain cards not being able to be used to their fullest
          extent. To solve this issue you can check/uncheck any action windows
          in your profile to determine when you’ll be prompted or not.
        </p>
        <h4 id="timed">Timed Interrupt Window</h4>
        <p>
          The combination of automated gameplay and the ability to play
          reactions or interrupts from hand has the potential to “leak”
          information about what your opponent might hold in his or her hand.
          For example: if after playing an event there is a pause before it
          resolves, you might guess correctly that was due to your opponent
          being prompted to use Voice of Honor. To solve this issue, the Timed
          Interrupt Window was created. Depending on which options you have
          checked, you get a timed prompt during certain triggers asking for
          interrupts whether you are able to interrupt these triggers or not.
          Now your opponent experiences the same pause any time and won’t be
          able to correctly guess whether you’re holding certain cards anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are a couple of options: you can decide whether you want to
          always be prompted for triggered card abilities , events or both. The
          timer duration can be modified too. Obviously, if you don’t care about
          leaking cards from your hand (or you don’t play these cards anyway)
          and just want a quick game, deselecting both options will allow for
          that. You will still get prompted to use the aforementioned cards, but
          only when you actually have them.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mmode">Manual Mode</h3>
        <p>
          Most of the cards should be implemented, but if things go wrong, or
          someone misclicks, or you really hate automation, you can switch on
          Manual Mode by typing /manual in chat.
        </p>
        <p>
          In Manual Mode, the game will no longer resolve conflicts
          automatically - the attacking player will be asked to indicate who won
          the conflict. You will also get the option to use a Manual Action in
          action windows which puts an announcement in chat and passes priority
          to your opponent, but won't have any other in-game effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In manual mode, clicking cards and rings will bring up a menu which
          allows you to easily change the game state. Most of the functions in
          these menus mirror the Manual Commands listed below, but there are a
          couple of things which can only be done in menus. The ring menu lets
          you flip a ring, which you can use to change the conflict type during
          conflicts. You can also change the contested ring by selecting the
          ring you want to switch to and choosing the appropriate menu button.
          Finally, there is also an option to initiate a conflict in case
          someone passed by accident. NB: Initiate Conflict can only be used
          during a pre-conflict action window, and it won't count against your
          conflict opportunities for the turn.
        </p>
        <h3 id="commands">Manual Commands</h3>
        <p>
          The following manual commands have been implemented in order to allow
          for a smoother gameplay experience:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>/discard x - Discards x cards randomly from your hand</li>

        </ul>
        <h3 id="conceding">About Stats, Conceding, and Leaving Games</h3>
        <p>
          Jigoku Online does not rank and/or match players by skill level in any
          way. There are three categories (beginner, casual and competitive) to
          be chosen when creating a game which gives an indication of what to
          expect, but it doesn't enforce anything. Even though personal stats
          are not being tracked, most players still very much appreciate a
          formal concede by clicking the ‘Concede’ button and typing ‘gg’ before
          leaving a game. The reality of quick and anonymous online games
          dictates this won’t always happen though, as evidenced by regular
          complaining in the main lobby about people leaving without conceding.
          Our advice is to just move on to the next game since in the end,
          conceding or not doesn’t really impact anything. Happy gaming!
